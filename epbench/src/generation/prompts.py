Write a detailed novel excerpt in a {style} style about {entity} attending a {content}. \
The story takes place on {date}, at {location}, where {entity} {content_single_detail}. Follow these guidelines:

Structure and Information Reveal:
{str_numbering}, while maintaining novel-appropriate paragraph lengths.
2. Gradually reveal key information:
- Full location '{location}': must appear verbatim in paragraph{s_paragraphs_location} {idx_location_str} only and nowhere else in the text
- Full date '{date}': must appear verbatim in paragraph{s_paragraphs_date} {idx_date_str} only and nowhere else in the text
- Full name '{entity}': must appear verbatim in paragraph{s_paragraphs_entity} {idx_entity_str} only and nowhere else in the text
- Full detail that '{first_name} {content_single_detail}': must appear verbatim in paragraph{s_paragraphs_content} {idx_content_str} and nowhere else in the text
3. Subtly distribute details about location, date, main character, and event across all paragraphs.

Content and Setting:
1. Focus on {first_name}'s experiences, observations, and interactions during the {content}.
2. Vividly describe surroundings, atmosphere, and {first_name}'s emotions.
3. Include the detail that {first_name} {content_single_detail}.
4. Limit the timeframe to a single day and confine all action to {location}.

Characters:
1. Refer to other characters as $entity_X (where X is a number).
2. Omit background information about {first_name} and other characters.

Style and Tone:
1. Use vivid, sensory details to bring the scene to life.
2. Incorporate elements of the {style} style, including {style_description}.
3. Maintain a consistent narrative voice throughout the excerpt.

Restrictions:
1. Only mention {location} and {date}; avoid other locations or dates.
2. Exclude explicit introductions, conclusions, or character backgrounds.
3. Focus exclusively on the events of this particular {content}.
4. Do not use a too common starting sentence.

Craft a seamless narrative that gradually reveals information while maintaining reader engagement throughout the excerpt.
